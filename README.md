# Bytewise-Limited-Fellowship-DataScinece
The ByteWise Limited fellowship in data science has a dedicated repository for participants to access tasks and related resources. The repository includes instructions, data sets, and a discussion forum. This structured and supportive environment helps participants learn and grow as data scientists, preparing them for successful careers.
### Week 2:
<i>Week 2 of our data science journey covered the basics of Python, including installation and environment setup, printing, input, data types, operators, and data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. We also delved into the world of strings and learned about their various methods. With these fundamental concepts under our belt, we're ready to tackle more advanced topics in the coming weeks.
Also, if you're interested in learning more about Python, check out this article I wrote on Medium for a comprehensive beginner's guide: https://medium.com/@Sahil_Ali/python-beginners-guide-50c102a776bc. It covers everything we've learned in Week 2 and more. Happy learning!<i>
### Week 3:
<i>Week 3 of our data science journey delved into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. We explored the Zen of Pythonic OOP best practices and design patterns, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. We also learned about SOLID principles, writing readable and maintainable code, common mistakes to avoid, and testing and debugging OOP code.
